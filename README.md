# Akakce Project

## Project Overview

The `Akakce Project` is a Selenium-based test automation project aimed at enhancing and personalizing the online shopping experience on Akakce.com. Developed by a team of seven students during a bootcamp, this project leverages technologies such as Java, HTML, Selenium WebDriver, and JUnit to implement a series of user stories ranging from account creation to deletion, ensuring a secure and tailored shopping journey.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Environment**: Ensure Java JDK 11+ is installed and configured in your IDE.

2. **Dependencies**: Use Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies. Add Selenium WebDriver and JUnit to your project:
   - **Selenium**: Add to `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`.
   - **JUnit**: Include in your project's build file.

3. **Build**: Synchronize and build your project to download the necessary libraries.

4. **Test**: Verify the setup with a basic Selenium test case using JUnit.

Check Selenium and JUnit documentation for specific version dependencies.




## Usage

To execute the test suite:

1. Use your IDE's built-in JUnit test runner. This is usually accessible by navigating to the `test` directory in your project structure.
2. Right-click on the test suite file or the directory you wish to run.
3. Select the `Run` option (the exact wording may vary by IDE).

This will execute the specified tests and provide you with feedback directly in your IDE.
